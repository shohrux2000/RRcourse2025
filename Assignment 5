## Task
The goal of this assignment was to practice reproducible coding standards, apply Git for version control, and connect programming to real-world research.

---

## Git Workflow Demonstrated
```bash
# Stage and commit new R script
git add lifeexp_analysis.R
git commit -m "feat: add life expectancy analysis with data cleaning and plots"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

This workflow illustrates best practices in collaborative research: writing meaningful commit messages, committing structured code, and synchronizing with a remote repository.

## Global Example: Life Expectancy and Health Data
To illustrate reproducibility with real-world data, I prepared an R script that analyzes **life expectancy across continents** (Gapminder dataset, 2007). This shows how health outcomes differ globally and how reproducible code can help in social science research.

```r
# R example: analyzing life expectancy
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)

data <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

print(data)
```

This script shows:
- **Data cleaning** and grouping.  
- **Summarization** of health outcomes by continent.  
- A reproducible workflow that can be documented and reused.

## Reflection
- Reproducible workflows benefit from clear documentation and proper Git usage.  
- Life expectancy is a globally relevant metric and demonstrates how coding can be applied to real-world social data.  
- Good version control habits (frequent commits, meaningful messages) ensure work is transparent and verifiable.
